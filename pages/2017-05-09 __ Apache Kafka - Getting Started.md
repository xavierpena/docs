Pluralsight course:

["Getting Started with Apache Kafka"](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/apache-kafka-getting-started/table-of-contents), by Ryan Plant.


# Before starting

This course provides some examples in Java, but Kafka can also be controlled via c#:

* [c# example: quick read](http://www.codeguru.com/csharp/.net/producer-and-consumer-for-kafka-in-.net-an-exploration.html)
* [17min youtube video: Simple Demo of Kafka Producer and Consumer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zG1qHt9vkuw)
* [.NET client for Apache Kafka on Github](https://github.com/confluentinc/confluent-kafka-dotnet) <= that one seems to be the state of the art at the moment
