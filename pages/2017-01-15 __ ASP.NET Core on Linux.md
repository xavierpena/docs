# ASP.NET Core on Linux


## Introduction

I've mainly followed Scott Hanselman's blog post: [ "Publishing an ASP.NET Core website to a cheap Linux VM host"](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/PublishingAnASPNETCoreWebsiteToACheapLinuxVMHost.aspx). Beware of the following gotchas:

* To configure the supervisor process of your app, use `/etc/supervisor/conf.d/dotnettest.conf` (for more details: [ supervisor online docs](http://supervisord.org/configuration.html)).
* Instead of `command=/usr/bin/dotnet /var/dotnettest/dotnettest.dll --server.urls:http://*:5123` it must be `command=/usr/bin/dotnet /var/dotnettest/dotnettest.dll --server.urls=http://*:5123`.
* The `hosting.json` is not automatically copied after build (thus nor after publish). You have to either add it to the project or copy it manually. If you mess up this part, the web will use :5000 and you won't understand what's going on (because nginx will be pointing at :5123).
* After changing `Program.cs`, you  must add this at the top of the file: `using Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration;`.
* If at any point you must restore the original configuration because you messed up: `sudo apt-get purge PACKET_NAME` (and then re-install)

If you want a more in-detail explanation, I suggest the official Microsoft doc: [ Publish to a Linux Production Environment](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/publishing/linuxproduction) (it doesn't use `supervisor` to run the asp.net instance, and it includes more advanced functionalities regarding securisation).

[Here](https://dzone.com/refcardz/net-on-linux) is another summary/reference: .NET on Linux.



## Find a suitable Linux VPS

I used http://ovh.com because I wanted something cheap based in Europe.


## Setup a user that isn't root

It's always a good idea to avoid being root. After logging into the system as root, make a new user and give them sudo (super user do):

	$ adduser mynewusername
	$ usermod -aG sudo mynewusername

Then I'll logout and go back in as mynewusername.


## Installing .NET Core on Linux

### Add the dotnet apt-get feed

Get ubuntu version:

	$ lsb_release -a

Add the dotnet apt-get feed (it will depend on your linux version):
https://www.microsoft.com/net/core#linuxubuntu

In my case:

	$ sudo sh -c 'echo "deb [arch=amd64] https://apt-mo.trafficmanager.net/repos/dotnet-release/ xenial main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/dotnetdev.list'
	$ sudo apt-key adv --keyserver hkp://keyserver.ubuntu.com:80 --recv-keys 417A0893
	$ sudo apt-get update

	
### Install .NET Core SDK

	$ sudo apt-get install dotnet-dev-1.0.0-preview2.1-003177

	
## Configuring your ASP.NET app

	// Program.cs:
	public static void Main(string[] args)
	{
		var config = new ConfigurationBuilder()
			.SetBasePath(Directory.GetCurrentDirectory())
			.AddJsonFile("hosting.json", optional: true)
			.Build();
	 
		var host = new WebHostBuilder()
			.UseKestrel()
			.UseConfiguration(config)
			.UseContentRoot(Directory.GetCurrentDirectory())
			.UseStartup<Startup>()
			.Build();
	 
		host.Run();
	}

	// hosting.json (in the root of the project):
	{
	  "server.urls": "http://localhost:5123"
	}


## Listening to the requests comming from the outside

We'll use Nginx (reverse proxy). This serve the requests comming from :80 to the Linux VPS.

	sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/default

Put the following content in the file. Basically it takes the :80 requests from the outside to be redirected to `http://localhost:5123`, which will be your asp running in your local machine and listening to port :5123.

	server {
		listen 80;
		location / {
			proxy_pass http://localhost:5123;
			proxy_http_version 1.1;
			proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
			proxy_set_header Connection keep-alive;
			proxy_set_header Host $host;
			proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
		}
	}
	
Attention: `http://localhost:5123` means that your website MUST listen to :5123. This is what we configured before in `hosting.json`.	
	
Reload nginx:
	  
	$ sudo nginx -t 
	$ sudo nginx -s reload
	

## Run your asp.net app locally and keep it alive

We'll use `supervisor` for that.

	$ sudo apt-get install supervisor
	
`supervisor` will load all *.config files under `/etc/supervisor/conf.d`. Set up a new one for your app:

	$ nano /etc/supervisor/conf.d/YOUR_APP_NAME.conf
	
And the contents must be:

	[program:YOUR_APP_NAME]
	command=/usr/bin/dotnet YOUR_APP_DLL --server.urls=http://*:5123
	directory=YOUR_APP_DIRECTORY
	autostart=true
	autorestart=true
	stderr_logfile=/var/log/YOUR_APP_NAME.err.log
	stdout_logfile=/var/log/YOUR_APP_NAME.out.log
	environment=ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT=Production
	user=www-data
	stopsignal=INT
	
...where:

	YOUR_APP_NAME = dotnettest
	YOUR_APP_DLL = /var/dotnettest/dotnettest.dll
	YOUR_APP_DIRECTORY = /var/dotnettest/
	
This will run the following command and it will keep it alive (it must listen to :5123, otherwise nginx won't be able to redirect the requests to our app):

	/usr/bin/dotnet YOUR_APP_DLL --server.urls=http://*:5123
	
Restart `supervisor`:
	
	$ sudo service supervisor stop
	$ sudo service supervisor start
	
	
Test if it works:

	$ sudo tail -f /var/log/supervisor/supervisord.log
	
	$ #and the application logs if you like
	$ sudo tail -f /var/log/YOUR_APP_NAME.out.log
	

## Debugging

You can run `dotnet run` on your code, it will listen to :5123 and you will be able to see it from the outside (if nginx is pointing to :5123).

If your app has any error, you can go to "YOUR_APP_DLL = /var/dotnettest/dotnettest.dll" and run `dotnet dotnettest.dll` to see if it works properly.

If your `hosting.json` is not OK, your asp.net core app will default to 5000.

There might be other instances running and listening to the same port. You might want to run `sudo netstat -ltp` to see those.

To look for a specific port:

	$ sudo lsof -i tcp:5123
	
It also helps to see if `sudo nginx` show the correct info.

	

## Deploy your app

I've seen that it is better to upload your code to Linux and run `dotnet build` / `dotnet publish` from there. There are some case-sensitivity problems that could make it work on Windows but not on Linux.

Although in theory you could run `dotnet build` / `dotnet publish` on Windows and upload the result to Linux.
 
 
## Bower

If you publish from your linux machine, you first need to run `bower install` so it retrieves the dependencies via npm (it's not done automatically as in Visual Studio).

Of course you need Bower installed first (otherwise on `dotnet publish` you will get the error "'bower' is not recognized as an internal or external command"):

    npm install -g bower

Running that in Ubuntu, I encountered this other problem:

	bower install
	/usr/bin/env: node: No such file or directory

The solution can be found [here](https://github.com/nodejs/node-v0.x-archive/issues/3911), which is adding a logical link in linux:

	ln -s /usr/bin/nodejs /usr/bin/node

Finally, repeat:

	bower install


## How to copy files from your windows machine to your linux machine

If you have [Ubuntu on Windows 10](http://www.howtogeek.com/249966/how-to-install-and-use-the-linux-bash-shell-on-windows-10/), your local drives are under /mnt.
	
We will upload it to `/home/your_user_name` (which is the same as `~`) because it has user permissions (/var doesn't, and we can't do sudo to a remote machine):

	scp -r /mnt/c/the/path/to/your/directory you_user_name@your_ip:~

Basically, it works like this:

To copy a file from A to B while logged into A:

	scp /path/to/file username@ip_address_of_B:/path/to/destination

To copy a directory, use "-r" (recursively copy entire directories)

	scp -r /path/to/directory username@ip_address_of_B:/path/to/destination
